- **Date:** 30 April 2014 (Superseding MIL-PRF-22750G, 2011)
- **Status:** Performance Specification approved for use by all Departments and Agencies of the DoD.

## 2. Scope and Classification
This specification covers the requirements for a two-component, high-solids epoxy coating with a maximum VOC of 340 g/l (2.8 lbs/gal). It is lead and chromate free.

### 2.1 Classification
- **Types:**
  - **Type II:** VOHAP-free (Volatile Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants-free).
  - **Type III:** Direct to metal (DTM), VOHAP-free, enhanced corrosion performance.
  - **Type IV:** Self-contained portable kits.
- **Classes:**
  - **Class H:** High solids, solvent base.
  - **Class W:** Water base.
- **Grades:**
  - **Grade A:** Weather resistant (Navy/Army equipment).
  - **Grade B:** Interior use (tactical equipment).

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Composition
- **Component A:** Epoxy resin and solvents.
- **Component B:** Polyamide and/or amine resin(s) and solvents (curing agent).
- **Environmental:** Lead, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium free. HAPS-free pigments.

### 3.2 Quantitative Requirements (Table I)
- **VOC Content:** Max 340 g/l.
- **Fineness of Grind:** 7 (Gloss), 6 (Semi-Gloss), 5 (Lusterless).
- **Specular Gloss (60°):**
  - Gloss: Min 90.
  - Semi-Gloss: 15-30.
  - Lusterless: Max 5.
- **Drying Time:**

- **Water Resistance:** 168 hours immersion; no blistering/wrinkling.
- **Hydrocarbon Fluid Resistance:** 168 hours in JP8; no blistering/wrinkling.
- **Fluid Resistance:** Resistant to lubricating oil (MIL-PRF-23699) at 250°F and hydraulic fluids at 150°F.
- **Heat Resistance:** Delta E <= 2.0 after 60 mins at 250°F.
- **Solvent Resistance (Cure):** Withstand 25 double rubs with MEK.
- **Corrosion Resistance (Type III DTM):**
  - Salt Spray: 1,000 hours.
  - Cyclic Corrosion: 40 cycles (GMW 14872).
- **Weathering:** 500 hours accelerated weathering (ASTM G155); Delta E < 3.0.
- **Strippability:** Min 90% stripped using TT-R-2918 remover.

## 4. Quality Assurance
- **Qualification:** Listing on Qualified Products Database (QPD) required.
- **Conformance:** Batch validation for VOC, solids, grind, mixing, spraying, drying, and gloss.

## 5. Key Technical Notes
- **Intended Use:** Interior topcoat for aircraft and ground support equipment; repair coating for Navy weapon systems.
- **Safety:** Requires Safety Data Sheets (SDS) per OSHA standards.
- **Toxicity:** Requires toxicity clearance for new chemicals in the Army supply system.
