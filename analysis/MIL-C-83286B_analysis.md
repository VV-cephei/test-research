# Technical Analysis: MIL-C-83286B

## 1. Document Overview
- **Title:** COATING, URETHANE, ALIPHATIC ISOCYANATE, FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS
- **Date:** 5 October 1973 (Superseding MIL-C-83286A)
- **Status:** Military Specification (USAF)

## 2. Scope and Classification
This specification establishes the requirements for a two-component, aliphatic isocyanate-based, oil-free urethane coating material suitable for exterior application on aerospace equipment.

### 2.1 Components
- **Component I:** Pigmented polyester resin.
- **Component II:** Clear aliphatic isocyanate reactant.

### 2.2 Types
- **Type I:** Suitable for application by conventional pressurized air spray techniques.
- **Type II:** Suitable for application by unheated, airless spray techniques.

### 2.3 Colors
- Furnished in any color and gloss range designated in FED-STD-595.
- Includes gloss and camouflage colors (e.g., Insignia Red, International Orange, Olive Drab, etc.).

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Composition and Mixing
- **Mixing Ratio:** One volume of Component II to one volume of Component I (1:1).
- **Solvents:** Must be non-photochemically reactive to meet air pollution control regulations.
- **Free Diisocyanate:** Shall not exceed 1% in the mixed coating.

### 3.2 Physical Properties (Mixed/Applied)
- **Viscosity (Mixed):** 17 to 23 seconds in a #2 Zahn cup.
- **Pot Life:** Minimum 6 hours.
- **Drying Time:**
  - Set-to-touch: Max 2 hours.
  - Dry-to-recoat: Max 1 hour.
  - Dry-hard: Max 6 hours.
- **Fineness of Grind:** Minimum 7 for gloss, 5 for camouflage.
- **Nonvolatile Content:** Minimum 52% for most gloss colors; 45% for camouflage.

### 3.3 Performance and Resistance
- **Adhesion:** No loss of adhesion in wet tape tests (72-hour cure).
- **Impact Flexibility:** Must meet specific percentage requirements (e.g., 60% for gloss) after various conditioning (heat aging, weathering, oil immersion).
- **Salt Spray Resistance:** 500 hours exposure with no corrosion.
- **Humidity Resistance:** 30 days at 120°F and 95% RH with no failure.
- **Heat Resistance:** 4 hours at 300°F.
- **Low Temperature Resistance:** Flexibility maintained at -65°F.
- **Fluid Resistance:** Resistant to:
  - Diester lubricating oil (250°F for 24 hours).
  - Hydrocarbon fluid (TT-S-735, Type III).
  - Hydraulic fluid (MIL-H-5606).
  - Skydrol 500B hydraulic fluid.
  - Distilled water (100°F for 4 days).
- **Weather Resistance:**
  - Accelerated: 500 hours in carbon arc weatherometer.
  - Outdoor: 1 year exposure in Florida.

## 4. Quality Assurance
- **Qualification Inspection:** Requires testing of three 1-quart kits.
- **Quality Conformance:** Batch-by-batch testing for acceptance, including 300-hour accelerated weathering.

## 5. Key Technical Notes
- The coating is intended for use over MIL-P-23377 epoxy-polyamide primer.
- Appendix I details the infrared spectroscopy method for determining free hexamethylene diisocyanate monomer.
