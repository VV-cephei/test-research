# Technical Analysis: MIL-C-83286B

## Summary
MIL-C-83286B is a military specification for a two-component, aliphatic isocyanate-based, oil-free urethane coating. It is designed for exterior application on aerospace equipment, providing high durability, weather resistance, and chemical resistance. The specification emphasizes pollution control, requiring non-photochemically reactive solvents.

## Technical Specifications

### Classification
- **Component I**: Pigmented polyester resin.
- **Component II**: Clear aliphatic isocyanate reactant.
- **Types**:
  - **Type I**: Suitable for conventional pressurized air spray.
  - **Type II**: Suitable for unheated, airless spray techniques.

### Composition & Mixing
- **Mixing Ratio**: 1:1 by volume (Component I to Component II).
- **Pot Life**: Minimum of 6 hours after mixing and reducing.
- **Solvents**: Must be urethane grade and non-photochemically reactive. Specific limits are set for olefinic unsaturation (5%), aromatic compounds with 8+ carbons (8%), and ethylbenzene/toluene/branched ketones (20%).

### Physical & Optical Properties
- **Gloss**:
  - Gloss Colors: Minimum 90 (at 60 degrees).
  - Camouflage Colors: Maximum 5 (at 60 degrees).
- **Hiding Power**: Contrast ratio of 0.85 to 0.95 depending on color at 0.002 inch dry film thickness.
- **Viscosity**: 17 to 23 seconds in a #2 Zahn cup for mixed material.
- **Drying Time**:
  - Set-to-touch: Max 2 hours.
  - Dry-to-recoat: Max 1 hour.
  - Dry-hard: Max 6 hours.

### Resistance Properties
- **Fluid Resistance**: Resistant to lubricating oil (250°F for 24h), hydrocarbon fluid (7 days), hydraulic fluid (7 days), and Skydrol 500B (7 days).
- **Weathering**:
  - Accelerated: 500 hours in twin carbon arc unit.
  - Outdoor: 1 year exposure in Florida.
- **Temperature**:
  - Heat Resistance: 4 hours at 300°F.
  - Low Temperature: Flexibility maintained at -65°F.
- **Corrosion**: 500 hours salt spray (5%) with no corrosion.
- **Humidity**: 30 days at 120°F and 95% RH.

## Critical Data Points
- **Free Isocyanate**: Must not exceed 1% in the mixed coating.
- **Adhesion**: Wet tape adhesion test requires no loss of adhesion between coats or substrate.
- **Impact Flexibility**: Specific percentage requirements (up to 60% for gloss) after various aging conditions (heat, weather, oil immersion).
- **Pencil Hardness**: Used to evaluate fluid resistance; failure defined by a decrease of more than 1-2 pencil hardness levels.

## Application Requirements
- **Surface Prep**: Requires cleaning and chemical film treatment (MIL-C-81706) on aluminum.
- **Primer**: Intended for use over MIL-P-23377 epoxy-polyamide primer.
- **Thickness**: Total dry film thickness (primer + topcoat) should be 2.6 to 3.2 mils.
