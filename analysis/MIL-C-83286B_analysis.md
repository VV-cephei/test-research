# Technical Analysis: MIL-C-83286B

## 1. Document Overview
**Title:** MIL-C-83286B(USAF) - Military Specification: Coating, Urethane, Aliphatic Isocyanate, for Aerospace Applications
**Date:** 5 October 1973
**Scope:** This specification establishes requirements for two-component aliphatic isocyanate-based oil-free urethane coating materials suitable for exterior application on aerospace equipment. It includes types suitable for use under local air pollution control regulations.

## 2. Key Technical Specifications
- **Composition:** Two-component system:
    - **Component I:** Pigmented polyester resin.
    - **Component II:** Clear aliphatic isocyanate reactant.
- **Mixing Ratio:** 1:1 by volume (Component I to Component II).
- **Classification:**
    - **Type I:** Suitable for application by conventional pressurized air spray techniques.
    - **Type II:** Suitable for application by unheated, airless spray techniques.
- **Viscosity:**
    - **Component I (Gloss):** 85-95 Krebs Units (KU).
    - **Component I (Camouflage):** 95-110 KU (Black up to 115 KU).
    - **Mixed Coating:** 17-23 seconds in a #2 Zahn cup.
- **Pot Life:** Minimum 6 hours.
- **Drying Time:**
    - Set-to-touch: 2 hours max.
    - Dry-to-recoat: 1 hour max.
    - Dry-hard: 6 hours max.
- **Nonvolatile Content:** 
    - Gloss: 52% min (except specific colors at 35%).
    - Camouflage/Semigloss: 45% min (except specific colors at 35%).

## 3. Requirements and Standards
- **Pollution Control:** Solvents must meet local air pollution control regulations (non-photochemically reactive).
- **Adhesion:** Wet tape adhesion test required with no loss of adhesion between coats or substrate.
- **Flexibility:** Impact flexibility testing (60% for gloss, 20% for camouflage) under various conditions (heat aging, weatherometer, fluid immersion).
- **Resistance Properties:**
    - **Salt Spray:** 500 hours (5% salt spray).
    - **Humidity:** 30 days at 95% RH and 120°F.
    - **Heat Resistance:** 4 hours at 300°F.
    - **Low Temperature:** Flexibility at -65°F.
    - **Fluid Immersion:** Resistance to lubricating oil (250°F), hydrocarbon fluid, hydraulic fluid (MIL-H-5606 and Skydrol 500B), and distilled water.
- **Weathering:** 500 hours accelerated weathering (300 hours for quality acceptance) and 1-year outdoor exposure in Florida.

## 4. Summary of Findings
MIL-C-83286B defines a high-performance, two-part aliphatic polyurethane coating system designed for the rigorous environment of aerospace exteriors. Key features include its resistance to a wide array of aviation fluids (including the aggressive Skydrol 500B), excellent color and gloss retention, and significant flexibility requirements even after environmental aging. The specification places a strong emphasis on "non-photochemically reactive" solvents to comply with early environmental regulations while maintaining the chemical and physical durability required for military aircraft.
