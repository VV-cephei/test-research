    - **Component A:** Epoxy resin and solvents.
    - **Component B:** Polyamide and/or amine resin(s) and solvents (curing agent).
- **Classification:**
    - **Type II:** VOHAP-free formulation.
    - **Type III:** Direct to metal (DTM), VOHAP-free, enhanced corrosion performance.
    - **Type IV:** Self-contained portable kits.
    - **Class H:** Solvent base.
    - **Class W:** Water base.
    - **Grade A:** Weather resistant (Navy/Army equipment).
    - **Grade B:** Interior use (tactical equipment).
- **VOC Content:** Maximum 340 g/l (2.8 lbs/gal).
- **Drying Time:**
    - Set-to-touch: 4 hours max.
    - Dry hard: 8 hours max.
- **Specular Gloss (60 degree):**
    - Gloss: 90 min.
    - Semi-gloss: 15-30.
    - Lusterless/Flat: 5 max.

## 3. Requirements and Standards
- **Environmental Standards:** Lead and chromate free. VOHAP-free (Types II and III).
- **Adhesion:** Dry tape (Scale 4B+) and Wet tape (Scale 4A+) adhesion tests.
- **Corrosion Resistance (Type III):** 
    - Salt Spray: 1,000 hours (ASTM B117).
    - Cyclic Corrosion: 40 cycles (GMW 14872).
- **Resistance Properties:**
    - **Water Resistance:** 168 hours immersion.
    - **Hydrocarbon Fluid:** 168 hours in JP8.
    - **Fluid Resistance:** 24 hours in lubricating oil (250°F) and hydraulic fluids (150°F).
    - **Heat Resistance:** Color change (Delta E ≤ 2.0) after 60 mins at 250°F.
    - **Solvent Resistance:** 25 double rubs with MEK.
    - **STB Resistance:** Resistance to Super Tropical Bleach.
- **Weathering:** 500 hours accelerated weathering (ASTM G155).

## 4. Summary of Findings
MIL-PRF-22750G represents a modern performance specification for high-solids epoxy coatings, emphasizing environmental compliance (low VOC, lead/chromate free, VOHAP-free) without sacrificing chemical resistance. While primarily intended for interior applications, Grade A provides weather resistance. The introduction of Type III (Direct to Metal) highlights a shift towards more efficient coating systems with significantly enhanced corrosion protection (1,000 hours salt spray). The specification is highly detailed regarding chemical resistance, particularly against modern aviation fluids and decontaminating agents like STB.
